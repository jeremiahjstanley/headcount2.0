# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to hone our data manipulation skills while practicing the creation and implementation of small, reusable React components. This project was built in one week with an assigned partner. 

This application was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate and opens with a page of cards containing statistical data from CO school districts ranging from 2004 - 2014.  The user is able to search for school districts in the search and the relevant cards remain on the screen.  There is also a comparison function where the user can select two districts by clicking on the cards.  The results of the comparison render to provide the user with district comparison data.
