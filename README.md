# HeadCount 2.0

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to hone our data manipulation skills while practicing the creation and implementation of small, reusable React components. This project was built in one week with an assigned partner.  [Marika] and [Jeremiah](https://github.com/jeremiahjstanley) have collaborated on previous projects and continue to hone their developer skills.

This application was built using the `create-react-app` boilerplate and opens with a page of cards containing statistical data from CO school districts ranging from 2004 - 2014.  The user is able to search for school districts in the search and the relevant cards remain on the screen.  There is also a comparison function where the user can select two districts by clicking on the cards.  The results of the comparison render to provide the user with district comparison data.
